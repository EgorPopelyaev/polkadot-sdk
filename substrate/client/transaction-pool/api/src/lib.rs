///
/// These events are being emitted by `TransactionPool` watchers,
/// which are also exposed over RPC.
///
/// The status events can be grouped based on their kinds as:
/// 1. Entering/Moving within the pool:
/// 		- [Future](TransactionStatus::Future)
/// 		- [Ready](TransactionStatus::Ready)
/// 2. Inside `Ready` queue:
/// 		- [Broadcast](TransactionStatus::Broadcast)
/// 3. Leaving the pool:
/// 		- [InBlock](TransactionStatus::InBlock)
/// 		- [Invalid](TransactionStatus::Invalid)
/// 		- [Usurped](TransactionStatus::Usurped)
/// 		- [Dropped](TransactionStatus::Dropped)
/// 	4. Re-entering the pool:
/// 		- [Retracted](TransactionStatus::Retracted)
/// 	5. Block finalized:
/// 		- [Finalized](TransactionStatus::Finalized)
/// 		- [FinalityTimeout](TransactionStatus::FinalityTimeout)
///
/// Transactions are first placed in either the `Ready` or `Future` queues of the transaction pool.
/// Substrate validates the transaction before it enters the pool.
///
/// A transaction is placed in the `Future` queue if it will become valid at a future time.
/// For example, submitting a transaction with a higher account nonce than the current
/// expected nonce will place the transaction in the `Future` queue.
///
/// The events will always be received in the order described above, however
/// there might be cases where transactions alternate between `Future` and `Ready`
/// pool, and are `Broadcast` in the meantime.
///
/// There is also only single event causing the transaction to leave the pool.
/// I.e. only one of the listed ones should be triggered.
///
/// Note that there are conditions that may cause transactions to reappear in the pool.
/// 1. Due to possible forks, the transaction that ends up being in included
/// in one block, may later re-enter the pool or be marked as invalid.
/// 2. Transaction `Dropped` at one point, may later re-enter the pool if some other
/// transactions are removed. A `Dropped` transaction may re-enter the pool only if it is
/// resubmitted.
/// 3. `Invalid` transaction may become valid at some point in the future.
/// (Note that runtimes are encouraged to use `UnknownValidity` to inform the pool about
/// such case). An `Invalid` transaction may re-enter the pool only if it is resubmitted.
/// 4. `Retracted` transactions might be included in some next block.
///
/// The `FinalityTimeout` event will be emitted when the block did not reach finality
/// within 512 blocks. This either indicates that finality is not available for your chain,
/// or that finality gadget is lagging behind. If you choose to wait for finality longer, you can
/// re-subscribe for a particular transaction hash manually again.
///
/// ### Last Event
///
/// The stream is considered finished when one of the following events happen:
/// - [Finalized](TransactionStatus::Finalized)
/// - [FinalityTimeout](TransactionStatus::FinalityTimeout)
/// - [Usurped](TransactionStatus::Usurped)
/// - [Invalid](TransactionStatus::Invalid)
/// - [Dropped](TransactionStatus::Dropped)
///
/// See [`TransactionStatus::is_final`] for more details.
///
/// ### Resubmit Transactions
///
/// Users might resubmit the transaction at a later time for the following events:
/// - [FinalityTimeout](TransactionStatus::FinalityTimeout)
/// - [Invalid](TransactionStatus::Invalid)
/// - [Dropped](TransactionStatus::Dropped)
///
